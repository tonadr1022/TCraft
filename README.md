# TCraft

TCraft is a rewrite of my [previous voxel engine](https://github.com/tonadr1022/VoxelEngine3D) in OpenGL 4.6 and C++.

## TODO

- attach data to world instead of general state: player position, camera orientation
- sky
- configurable terrain generation
- add block editor
- orbit camera for block editor
- raycasting to select blocks
- GUI displaying blocks and highlighted blocks with keybinds to switch between or click on with mouse in editor
- multithread chunk loading and meshing
- multithread texture loading
- chunk serialization
