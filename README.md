# TCraft

TCraft is a rewrite of my [previous voxel engine](https://github.com/tonadr1022/VoxelEngine3D) in OpenGL 4.6 and C++.

## Features

- Multithreaded terrain generation and meshing
- Block editor to change and add block models and blocks
- World creation
- Block breaking and placing
- Baked ambient occlusion
- Efficient greedy meshing
- Orbit and FPS Camera

## TODO

- sky
- configurable terrain generation
- Better block editor GUI and experience
- multithread texture loading
- chunk serialization
- Better shading and lighting
